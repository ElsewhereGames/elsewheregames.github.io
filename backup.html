    <h1>No Dates!</h1>

    <p>I decided to try out the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site generator for this blog; <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitLab</a> will host the site for you, and all you have to is push Markdown-formatted files to a special repository (provided you don&#39;t want to use third-party Jekyll plug-ins). When looking through a few sample sites and tutorials, I noticed that all blogs prominently show a date with their posts.</p>

<p>Dating posts may have been useful when diaries were used to keep track of important life-events, but serve no use for technical blogs on the web.</p>

<h2>Dates Provide Little Context</h2>

<p>Software generally does not use dates to differentiate between API or feature set. Instead, it relies on something that can relay much more contextual information, a version number. Provided the right approach to versioning is used, you can tell if a release contains mayor features or just bug fixes.</p>

<p>One thing you can learn from dates with posts is how active the writer is. However, with todays integration of social media, figuring out whether a writer contributes frequently should be easy. Especially when using GitHub pages, the date at which a post was written is pointless if the author can go in and update the post so easily. Unfortunately, Jekyll does not seem to provide a last-edited variable for posts, although you can add your own.</p>

<h2>Dates are Complex</h2>

<p>There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calendars">many different calendars</a>. Which one should you use? Do you display the full names of months, or just their numerical identifier? Anyone who has ever had code a scheduling system knows that dates are hard to code for. Word has it that Java 8 will finally provide a decent <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/">Date-Time</a> API.</p>

<h2>The Quest for Perfection</h2>

<p>In the end, it came down my desire to remove features until the essence remains. I didn&#39;t think dates added anything, so they had to go. I had to make a few changes to the Jekyll configuration to excludes dates from permalinks:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">permalink: /:categories/:title.html
</code></pre></div>
<p>Posts still require a date in the file name, but at least these are not front-facing.</p>
