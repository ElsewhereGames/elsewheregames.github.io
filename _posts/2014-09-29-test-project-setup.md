## Testing

Before I cover how I usually set up my test projects, I want to provide some background on where I see automated testing being useful to help explain my approach.

Ensuring a code-base can be quickly validated to perform certain functions and features base on a set of automated tests is nice, but is not where the main pay-off comes from. A good suite of tests:

- Provides an overview of the code base
- Allows a developer to quickly diagnose and address bugs
- Enforces modularity of the code base
