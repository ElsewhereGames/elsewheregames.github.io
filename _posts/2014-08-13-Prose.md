While setting up and configuring [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) is really easy, I stopped writing after the first post. The main contributing factor (other than adding a [new member to the family](http://instagram.com/p/rlRgQbOdAJ/)) is that there is still quite a bit of overhead to writing a post.

I stumbled on in [Prose.io](http://prose.io/), and its online editing of markdown files in Github repositories has everyone I am looking for:

* Web-based client
* Direct integration with GithHub
* Easy way to insert images
